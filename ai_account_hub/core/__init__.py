"""Tk-free backend for AI Account Hub.

The bulk of the backend lives in :mod:`ai_account_hub.core.hub_core` (constants,
provider probes/refresh, limit parsing, usage history, discovery reuse, and
launch/browser helpers). This package re-exposes every public ``hub_core``
attribute so callers can simply do ``from ai_account_hub import core`` and use
``core.NAME`` — the historical access point (formerly ``legacy_backend``).
