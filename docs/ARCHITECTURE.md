# AI Account Hub architecture

Developer notes for the standalone `ai_account_hub` application. For setup and
normal use, see the top-level [`README.md`](../README.md). For target-OS work,
see [`PORTING_MACOS_LINUX.md`](PORTING_MACOS_LINUX.md).

The Hub is a pass-through account dashboard and launcher. It does not proxy
provider traffic, combine credentials, or replace the official provider tools.

## Startup path

All supported Python entry points converge on the same application bootstrap:

```text
Start-AI-Account-Hub.bat (Windows source bootstrap)
             or main.py
             or python -m ai_account_hub
                         |
                         v
              ai_account_hub.app.main()
                         |
                         v
              QApplication + MainWindow
```

`main.py` installs the top-level exception logger. `app.py` owns Qt application
creation, platform application identity, and a launcher-root-scoped local
single-instance channel. A later launch asks the existing Hub to restore its
window and exits, leaving one timer and one writer for the profile store.
`MainWindow` owns the visible window, Statistics and Accounts screens, timers,
tray controller, and orderly shutdown.

```

The public package contains the Statistics workspace and Accounts
dashboard. Provider apps and CLIs continue to own prompts and execution.

## Data flow

1. `MainWindow` creates `StatisticsScreen`, `AccountsScreen`, `TrayController`,
   and `AccountNotificationMonitor`.
2. Account workers call the blocking `data.refresh_one()` API off the UI thread.
3. `data.py` delegates to `HubEngine`, which uses the provider's official CLI,
   desktop state, or documented local files.
4. `hub_core` normalizes limits/state and records history in SQLite.
5. The Accounts screen refreshes cards, calendar, stats, detail rail, tray
   widget, and notification monitor from the same profile dictionaries.
6. `StatisticsScreen` debounces profile-update bursts and launches its numeric
   Codex/Claude scan in a below-normal-priority helper process. The Qt worker
   waits for the privacy-safe JSON result, keeping Python parser CPU and the GIL
   out of the GUI process. Frozen builds retain an in-process compatibility
   fallback until their packager supplies the helper entry point.
   `benchmark_analytics` caches one aggregate per provider task, derives limit
   burn only from adjacent snapshots less than 20 minutes apart, and builds
   effort-level numeric groups. The UI then derives base-model navigation while
   retaining the original effort groups for reasoning filters, chart series,
   attribution, Compare baselines/full-value bars/deltas, and export. Prompt text, response text, reasoning content,
   source, diffs, commands, file paths, and tool output are not retained.
7. The Community screen reads bounded public aggregates without requiring
   consent. When the user explicitly opts in, `community_api` reduces the
   current numeric groups to the allowlisted daily schema and signs the request
   with the installation identity. The Cloudflare Worker verifies the schema,
   signature, timestamp, nonce, rate limit, and daily uniqueness before writing
   private D1/R2 state. Qualifying model/reasoning rollups are published only
   after the configured distinct-installation threshold is met.

No worker should modify Qt widgets. Results return through Qt signals and the UI
thread performs rendering.

## Core facade

UI and engine modules normally use:

```python
from ai_account_hub import core as L
```

`core/__init__.py` re-exports the shared backend API from `hub_core.py` and the
smaller core modules. Tests that patch path constants must patch the underlying
module referenced by `L.mod`; patching only a copied facade attribute does not
change functions that close over `hub_core` globals.

## Provider boundaries

- **Codex**: an isolated `CODEX_HOME` is passed to `codex app-server`. The Node
  helper warms the selected account and reconciles several rate-limit reads,
  because a newly started app-server can briefly expose a default empty window.
  When an exhausted window first appears reset, the Hub preserves the previous
  card and shows Verifying. It polls that account again after one minute and
  accepts the second successful Codex report exactly as returned. This targeted
  verification continues even when general Auto Refresh is disabled.
- **Claude Code**: each profile has an isolated config directory. Claude Desktop
  capture/switch logic is separate because CLI and Desktop authentication are
  independent provider sessions. Local usage keeps one maximum non-zero usage
  record per global assistant-message ID because Claude may copy the same
  message into several JSONL transcripts.
- **Statistics attribution**: Codex Desktop's default home supplies the
  shared model and reasoning-effort timeline. The selected account's app-server
  remains authoritative for that login's daily total. The Hub applies the
  same-day shared model/effort mix to each account total, or the latest shared
  setting when that day has no turn metadata, and labels those tokens as
  inferred. Exact per-profile turns remain observed. Unknown input/cache/output
  composition stays unclassified, and every account/day total is preserved.
- **Observable work**: Codex task lifecycle, patch, command, test, rollback and
  compaction events and Claude task/tool events are reduced to numeric counters.
  Duplicate transcript copies merge by stable task identity using the most
  complete observation, never by summing copies. Files are represented only by
  SHA-256 hashes so unique-file counts can be computed without storing paths.
- **Productivity Density**: the UI presents tokens, active time, limit burn,
  tasks, edits, files, lines, tests and commands as a bundle. There is no
  composite score, quality claim, survey, prompt classification, or synthetic
  benchmark. Account IDs are filters. The model picker and comparison table
  aggregate by provider and base model; graphics, reasoning filters, and CSV
  exports retain provider, model, and reasoning effort.
- **Cursor**: Desktop, shell launcher, and Cursor Agent are distinct discovered
  capabilities. Missing quota fields stay `not exposed`.
- **Antigravity**: Desktop and a healthy standalone `agy` are separate
  capabilities; provider-owned login remains external to the Hub.

Provider discovery proves that software exists and can often answer
`--version`. It does not prove that an account is logged in.

## Community trust boundary

Community sharing is a separate opt-in path and is not involved in account
switching, provider launches, or local Statistics. The desktop contains the
public Worker URL but no Cloudflare API token, R2 key, D1 credential, shared
upload secret, or provider credential.

The installation private key is encrypted for the current Windows user with
DPAPI. Only its public key and derived pseudonymous installation ID cross the
network. Turning sharing off stops future uploads; signed withdrawal removes
accepted submissions and the local signing identity. Public results remain
available while sharing is off.

For Store Codex builds on Windows, discovery may stage only the package's
official CLI executable under the Hub runtime root because direct execution
from `WindowsApps` can be denied. The staged file is refreshed atomically from
the installed package and contains no account state.

## Tray lifecycle

`TrayController` is created with the main window and owns:

- `QSystemTrayIcon` and its context menu
- the compact Best Next popup
- widget visibility settings
- Signal Rail delivery and the native-message fallback

Minimize hides the main window only when the tray icon is actually available.
Close exits the Hub, stops workers, closes overlays/popups, and removes the tray
icon. The tray's explicit Exit action follows the same shutdown path.

## Notifications

`AccountNotificationMonitor` compares consecutive profile snapshots and emits
structured account events only for meaningful transitions. It latches warnings
to avoid repeating the same low-usage event every refresh.

`SignalRailManager` renders those events as themed `Qt.Tool` windows. It owns at
most three notifications, anchors them to the tray/screen work area, pauses the
timer on hover, and routes card clicks back to the relevant profile. Native
`QSystemTrayIcon.showMessage()` is only a fallback when the custom overlay
cannot be shown.

## Local state and security

Runtime data lives under `AI_HUB_LAUNCHER_ROOT` or the platform default, never
inside the source/package directory. It includes profiles, settings, SQLite
history, browser profiles, logs, generated icons, desktop-switch state, and the
optional Windows Store Codex CLI staging copy. Opted-in Community sharing also
stores the DPAPI-protected installation key and the last non-secret receipt in
this external runtime root.

The discovery report contains installation paths and versions only. It must not
contain provider tokens, cookies, auth files, or a full environment dump.

## Standalone packaging

A frozen build bundles provider icons, the Codex Node helper, Qt plugins,
the public setup/security documents, and current README screenshots. It must
resolve those files
at their source-relative paths so `__file__` resolves them in PyInstaller's
one-folder resource directory instead of assuming the source checkout
is beside `__file__`.

User state must remain outside the frozen directory or macOS `.app` bundle. See
the porting guide for the full resource and lifecycle contract.

## Development checks

From the repository root:

```text
python -m compileall -q ai_account_hub
node --check scripts/codex-account-limits-helper.mjs
```

Offscreen boot test:

```text
set QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
set AI_HUB_LAUNCHER_ROOT=<temporary-directory>
py -3 -c "from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication; from ai_account_hub.ui.main_window import MainWindow; app=QApplication([]); MainWindow(app); print('boots')"
```

Never run tests against the maintainer's real launcher root.
